[Compilation]

Build Requirements:
1. Java JDK 1.6 or greater
2. maven3

To compile Clickminer from the directory containing the pom.xml file execute:

mvn compile

This will build all of the class files and place them into the target/classes directory.

To clean up the build from the same directory execute:

mvn clean

To package the Clickminer classes as a jar execute:

mvn package

This will create a jar file in the target directory.

To package the Clickminer and its dependencies as an executable jar execute:

mvn compile assembly:single

This will create a jar file in the target directory with 'executable' in the filename.

Note: You should perform a clean action each time before compiling or packaging the code.
