Opened Firefox to http://www.cnet.com/
Clicked on the Outlook.com flash ad, landed on (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/home?ocid=CNET_CU_SF_OUT_New_Welcome_970x66V1R1)
Closed Firefox

Purpose: To test flash ads
Note: this trace requires native events to be activated,  there are still issues
with the mouse action activating the a:hover action of the menu above the flash
object, thereby blocking the object from view and stealing the click.
